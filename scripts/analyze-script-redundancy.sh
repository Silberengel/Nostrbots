# Recommendations
print_header "RECOMMENDATIONS:"
echo "=================="

echo "   - Key generation script (01-generate-key.sh)"
echo "   - Verification scripts (03-verify-environment.sh, 05-verify-setup.sh)"

echo "2. CONSIDER REMOVING these scripts (redundant with Docker):"
echo "   - 01-install-orly.sh"
echo "   - 02-configure-orly.sh" 
echo "   - 03-verify-orly.sh"
echo "   - setup-orly-complete.sh"

echo "3. KEEP BUT MARK as legacy:"
echo "   - test-hello-world.sh (useful for non-Docker setups)"
echo "   - quick-test.sh (useful for CI/CD)"
echo ""
echo "4. UPDATE documentation to reflect:"
echo "   - Docker is now the primary deployment method"
echo "   - Individual scripts are for advanced users"
echo "   - Jenkins scripts are still required for CI/CD"
