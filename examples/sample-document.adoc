= The Complete Guide to Nostr

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about the Nostr protocol.
From basic concepts to advanced implementation details, this document serves as your
complete reference for understanding and using Nostr effectively.

Whether you're a developer looking to build on Nostr or a user wanting to understand
how it works, this guide has something for everyone.

== Getting Started

This section covers the fundamental concepts and initial setup.

=== What is Nostr?

Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a simple, open protocol 
that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.

The protocol is designed around two main components:
- **Clients**: Applications that users interact with
- **Relays**: Servers that store and forward messages

=== Key Concepts

Understanding these core concepts is essential for working with Nostr.

==== Cryptographic Identity

Your Nostr identity is based on cryptographic keys:
- **Private key (nsec)**: Your secret key for signing events
- **Public key (npub)**: Your public identity that others use to find you

==== Events

Everything in Nostr is an "event" - a JSON message that contains:
- Your signature (proving it came from you)
- A timestamp
- Content (text, media references, etc.)
- Tags (metadata and references to other events)

==== Relays

Relays are servers that store and forward Nostr messages. Unlike traditional social media:
- You can connect to multiple relays simultaneously
- If one relay goes down or censors you, you can use others
- Anyone can run a relay, creating a truly distributed network

== Technical Implementation

This section covers the technical aspects of implementing Nostr.

=== Protocol Specification

The Nostr protocol is defined through NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities).

==== Core NIPs

Essential NIPs that every implementation should support:

===== NIP-01: Basic Protocol

This is the foundational NIP that defines the core protocol structure.

Events are JSON objects with the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": "event_id_hash",
  "pubkey": "author_public_key",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "Hello Nostr!",
  "sig": "signature"
}
```

===== NIP-02: Contact Lists

Defines how to manage and share contact lists between clients.

===== NIP-23: Long-form Content

Enables publishing longer articles and blog posts with rich formatting.

=== Client Development

Building Nostr clients requires understanding several key areas.

==== Connection Management

Efficient relay connection management is crucial for good user experience.

==== Event Processing

Handling incoming events efficiently while maintaining data integrity.

==== User Interface

Creating intuitive interfaces that hide the complexity of the protocol.

== Advanced Topics

For developers and power users who want to dive deeper.

=== Running Your Own Relay

Setting up and maintaining a Nostr relay for maximum control.

=== Custom Event Kinds

Creating new event kinds for specialized use cases.

=== Integration Patterns

How to integrate Nostr with existing applications and services.

== Conclusion

Nostr represents a fundamental shift toward user sovereignty and freedom of expression.
By removing central authorities and giving users control over their data and connections,
Nostr enables a more open and resilient social web.

The future of social networking is decentralized, and Nostr is leading the way.
