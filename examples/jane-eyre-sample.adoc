= Jane Eyre

An Autobiography by Charlotte BrontÃ«

There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, 
in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, 
when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it 
clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was 
now out of the question.

This opening sets the tone for the entire novel, establishing the dreary atmosphere 
and Jane's constrained circumstances from the very beginning.
