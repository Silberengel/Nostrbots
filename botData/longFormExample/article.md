# Getting Started with Nostr

Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.

## What Makes Nostr Different?

Unlike traditional social media platforms, Nostr doesn't rely on a central server or company. Instead, it uses a network of relays to distribute messages. Here are the key differences:

### Decentralization
- No single point of failure
- No central authority controlling content
- Users own their identity and data

### Censorship Resistance
- Content is distributed across multiple relays
- Users can switch relays if one becomes unavailable
- No single entity can silence users

### Simplicity
- The protocol is intentionally simple
- Easy to implement and understand
- Extensible through NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities)

## Getting Started

To start using Nostr, you need:

1. **A Nostr client** - There are many available for different platforms
2. **A key pair** - Your identity on the network
3. **Relay connections** - To send and receive messages

### Generating Keys

Your Nostr identity consists of:
- **Private key (nsec)** - Keep this secret! It's like your password
- **Public key (npub)** - Share this with others to follow you

### Choosing Relays

Relays are servers that store and forward Nostr messages. You can:
- Connect to multiple relays for redundancy
- Choose relays based on your interests or location
- Run your own relay for maximum control

## The Future of Social Media

Nostr represents a fundamental shift toward user sovereignty and freedom of expression. By removing central authorities and giving users control over their data and connections, Nostr enables a more open and resilient social web.

Whether you're interested in free speech, decentralization, or just want to try something new, Nostr offers a compelling alternative to traditional social media platforms.
