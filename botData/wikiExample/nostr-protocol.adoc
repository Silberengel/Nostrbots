= Nostr Protocol

The **Nostr Protocol** (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a simple, open protocol that enables global, decentralized, and censorship-resistant social media.

== Overview

[[Nostr]] was designed to address the fundamental problems with centralized social media platforms by creating a truly decentralized alternative that puts users in control of their data and identity.

.Key Features
* *Decentralized*: No single point of failure or control
* *Censorship-resistant*: Content distributed across multiple [[relays]]  
* *Simple*: Minimal protocol that's easy to implement
* *Extensible*: Can be extended through [[NIPs]] (Nostr Implementation Possibilities)

== Architecture

The Nostr protocol consists of two main components:

=== Clients
[[Clients]] are applications that users interact with to create, read, and manage content. Examples include:

* Web applications
* Mobile apps  
* Desktop applications
* Command-line tools

=== Relays
[[Relays]] are servers that store and forward Nostr events. Key characteristics:

* Simple WebSocket servers
* Store events temporarily or permanently
* Can implement custom policies
* Users can connect to multiple relays simultaneously

== Events

Everything in Nostr is an "event" - a JSON message containing:

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "event_id_hash",
  "pubkey": "author_public_key", 
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [],
  "content": "Hello Nostr!",
  "sig": "signature"
}
----

=== Event Kinds

Different event kinds serve different purposes:

.Common Event Kinds
[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Kind |Purpose

|1 |Short text notes (like tweets)
|3 |Contact lists  
|7 |Reactions (likes, etc.)
|30023 |[[Long-form content]] (articles)
|30818 |[[Wiki articles]]
|===

== Cryptographic Identity  

Users have cryptographic identities consisting of:

* **Private key** (nsec): Secret key for signing events
* **Public key** (npub): Public identity shared with others

This cryptographic foundation ensures:

* Authenticity: Events are cryptographically signed
* Ownership: No central authority can take away your identity  
* Portability: Your identity works across all Nostr applications

== Network Effects

The Nostr network benefits from several positive feedback loops:

=== Relay Diversity
* More relays → Better censorship resistance
* Competition between relays → Better service quality
* Geographic distribution → Better global access

=== Client Competition  
* Multiple clients → Innovation and user choice
* Open protocol → Easy to build new clients
* Interoperability → Users not locked into one app

== Challenges and Limitations

While powerful, Nostr faces several challenges:

=== Spam and Abuse
Without central moderation, dealing with spam and abuse requires:

* Client-side filtering
* Web-of-trust mechanisms
* Relay-level policies

=== Scalability
As the network grows, considerations include:

* Storage requirements for relays
* Bandwidth usage
* Event discovery and search

=== User Experience
Making decentralized systems user-friendly requires:

* Simplified key management
* Intuitive client interfaces  
* Reliable relay connections

== Future Development

The Nostr ecosystem continues to evolve through:

* New [[NIPs]] extending functionality
* Improved client applications
* Enhanced relay implementations
* Growing developer community
