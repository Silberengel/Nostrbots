== Opening Prayer

O God, come to my assistance.
O Lord, make haste to help me.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.

== Magnificat

My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.

From this day all generations will call me blessed:
the Almighty has done great things for me,
and holy is his Name.

He has mercy on those who fear him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of his arm,
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.

He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty.

He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,
the promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and his children for ever.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.

== Intercessions

Let us pray to the Lord, who is our light and our salvation:

- For all who have died today, that they may rest in peace
- For our families and loved ones, that they may be protected through the night
- For those who work through the night, that they may be safe and blessed
- For the Church throughout the world, that she may be a sign of hope

== Closing Prayer

Lord, as we prepare for rest,
we thank you for the blessings of this day.
Watch over us through the night,
and grant us peaceful sleep.
May we wake refreshed and ready
to serve you in the new day;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

== Blessing

May the Lord grant us a peaceful night
and a perfect end. Amen.
